hi, I want to try to make a program to find the songs from a spotify playlist and download them to mp3 from somewhere. for now I'm going to find them on youtube and download them from there

You should create a file private.py and declarate this variables CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_PRIVATE (client_secret) of spotify developer

You also have to have these libraries installed
> youtube_dl     
> spotipy   
> bs4   
> kivy  

I'm going to try to use kivy for gui
